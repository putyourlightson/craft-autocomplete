# Autocomplete for Craft CMS

Provides autocompletion for Craft and plugins in Twig templates. 
 
This package is intended to be used with the Symfony Plugin for PhpStorm: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7219-symfony-plugin
 
Adapted from `FauxTwigExtension.php` by nystudio107 as documented in the article: https://nystudio107.com/blog/auto-complete-craft-cms-3-apis-in-twig-with-phpstorm

## Installation

Install the package using composer.

```
composer require putyourlightson/craft-autocomplete
```

Once PhpStorm indexes the `Autocomplete.php` file, autocompletion will become available in your Twig templates.

## Contributing

You can contribute autocompletion for third-party plugins that are available in the plugin store. To do so, please submit a pull request, ensuring you follow the structure already in place.
